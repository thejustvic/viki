You can add some cards and see how it works with checklists and chat on the left. You can resize both left and right navbars, left emoji on the messages, change theme.
You can add members to your team, create multiple teams of your own, or jump to a team you've been invited to.

Visualized checklists in 3D, I had the idea of ​​setting up a Christmas tree, since it’s New Year’s, and hanging baubles on the tree that represent checkboxes, that is, red or green baubles appear on the tree. What’s interesting is that you can move near the tree freely, even jump and climb to the very top.
